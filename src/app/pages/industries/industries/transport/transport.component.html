                The transport sector moves goods and people, employs millions of workers, generates revenue, and consumes materials and services produced by other sectors of the economy.
              </p>
  
              <p class="mb-4">
                Transport is a critical component of economic development, globally and nationally. Transportation availability affects global development patterns and can be a boost or a barrier to economic growth within individual nations.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-4">
                The transport industry forms the backbone of modern global supply chains. Airlines and airports, shipping companies, logistics service providers and other transport companies are all part of the process to keep people and products on the move.
