                In a rapidly evolving business and regulatory environment, the
                right guidance is more important than ever. The BDO audit approach
                is applied consistently across the network through the use of the
                BDO Audit Manual, a core technical document that complies fully
                with international auditing standards. BDO Nigeria adds relevant
                guidance to address the national statutory and professional
                requirements. Auditing is not a static process and we recognize
                the need to offer our clients the best possible range of
                compliance and advisory services and we therefore ensure the
                continual development and enhancement of our range of audit tools.
