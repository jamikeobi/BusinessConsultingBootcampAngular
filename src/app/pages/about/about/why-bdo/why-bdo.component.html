                      Why BDO Consulting?
                    </h4> -->
              <p class="mb-4">
                Our vision is to be the leader for exceptional client service and this means a laser focus on quality in all of BDO’s 1,803 ofﬁces in 164 countries and territories, in order to ensure the consistent delivery of exceptional service worldwide. For us, exceptional client service is based on ﬁve key components that define BDO today: client needs, communication, commitment, people and value.
              </p>

              <h4>Client needs</h4>
  
              <p class="mb-4">
                BDO works with clients listed on all of the world’s major stock markets and we are the adviser of choice for many of the largest private companies in each territory where we have a presence. We invest a great deal of time in getting to know our clients: building personal relationships so that we can anticipate their needs and offer genuine added value. We aim always to fulﬁl our clients’ complex needs, through a combination of  in-depth local market knowledge and global industry expertise and technical skills.
              </p>

              <h4>Communication</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Our top priority is to be clear, open and swift in all our communication. In practice, this means ensuring short lines of communication so our clients always know who to talk to. Our client teams, including our senior professionals, are easily contactable so their experience in offering in-depth industry expertise and commercially astute insights is readily available.


              </p>


              <h4>Commitment</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Our constant drive towards achieving the high expectations of our clients is in our DNA. This means that every BDO Member Firm is committed to providing the consistently high-quality service delivery to meet their clients’ needs. We put this commitment into practice through the demanding client service standards that all our member ﬁrms are required to meet and we have also implemented a global Net Promoter Score (NPS) programme to facilitate the gathering of client feedback, specifically with reference to our vision’s five attributes. Our clients appreciate the outcome: efﬁcient, constructive, workable and timely solutions, tailored to their particular needs.


              </p>


              <h4>People</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">
                In every BDO ﬁrm we employ experienced people and empower them to make a difference through top-class training, opportunities and reward. By providing the right environment for our people and the right people for our clients, we ensure a focus on the delivery of exceptional client service in all our firms. Our people are proud to work for BDO and this is clearly seen when they talk about the international network and their interaction with clients

              </p>

              <h4>Value</h4>
              <p class="mb-4">
                At BDO, we believe that our new ideas and innovative thinking help clients achieve their objectives and contribute to their commercial success – now and in the future. The actionable advice we provide is backed by local and regional expertise, together with global experience. In our increasingly globalised economy that is an essential added value factor for every client’s business.
