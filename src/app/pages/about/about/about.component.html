                        BDO Nigeria is a member firm of BDO International and maintains the same high standards that the global body is known for. Its roots trace back to Coopers & Lybrand, where the local firm Oyediran, Faleye, Oke & Co operated as a parallel indigenous practice with Coopers & Lybrand. However, Oyediran, Faleye, Oke & Co was severed from the umbilical cord binding it to Coopers & Lybrand, effective from July 1, 1998, following the global merger of Coopers & Lybrand with Price Waterhouse. Consequently, Oyediran, Faleye, Oke & Co joined BDO International B.V.
