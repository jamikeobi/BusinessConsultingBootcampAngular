              In a rapidly evolving business and regulatory environment, the
              right guidance is more important than ever. The KWAMU audit approach
              is applied consistently across the network through the use of the
              KWAMU Audit Manual, a core technical document that complies fully
              with international auditing standards. KWAMU Nigeria adds relevant
              guidance to address the national statutory and professional
              requirements. Auditing is not a static process and we recognize
              the need to offer our clients the best possible range of
              compliance and advisory services and we therefore ensure the
              continual development and enhancement of our range of audit tools.
